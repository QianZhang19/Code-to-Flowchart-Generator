# Code to Flowchart

Hey there! üëã Welcome to **Code to Flowchart** , this is a Python tool that turns your code into the easy-to-understand flowcharts. Whether you're trying to explain your algorithm to teammates, document your code, or just visualise your logic, this tool has got you covered!

## üìä From Code to Visual in Seconds

**Here's a simple Python example:**

```python
def calculate_sum(n):
    """Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n."""
    total = 0
    i = 1

    while i <= n:
        total += i
        i += 1

    return total

def main():
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

    result = calculate_sum(number)

    # Display the result
    print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to {number} is: {result}")
```

**And here's the flowchart it generates:**

## ‚ú® What's Cool About This Tool

- **Simple to use** - Just point it at your Python file and watch the magic happen
- **Grid-based layout** - Everything is aligned for that professional look
- **Smart shape sizing** - Automatically adjusts shape sizes based on flowchart complexity

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repo to your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/co_to_f.git
   cd co_to_f
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Quick Start

The simplest way to use it:

```bash
python code_to_flowchart.py your_python_file.py
```

That's it! You'll get a nice flowchart saved as a PNG file.

## üé® Color Schemes

- **standard**: Professional blue/green theme
- **pastel**: Soft, easy-on-the-eyes colors
- **monochrome**: Classic black and white
- **colorful**: Vibrant colors for presentations

## üß† Smart Features

### Dynamic Shape Sizing

The tool is smart enough to know when your flowchart is getting complex:

- **Simple flowcharts** (< 10 nodes): Uses larger, more readable shapes
- **Complex flowcharts** (> 10 nodes): Automatically shrinks shapes to fit everything nicely

## ü§ù Contributing

I'd absolutely love your help making this tool even better! This project is all about community, and your ideas and contributions can make a huge difference.

Here's how you can join in:
- **Got an idea?** Open an issue and let's talk about it!
- **Found a bug?** Let me know so we can squash it together
- **Want to add a feature?** Submit a pull request - all contributions are welcome, big or small
- **Made something cool?** Share your flowchart creations and inspire others!

Even if you're new to open source, I'd be happy to help you get started. We were all beginners once!

## üîÆ What's Coming Next

I'm actively exploring some exciting new features:

- **Real-time output** - See your flowchart build as you type your code
- **Interactive flowcharts** - Click on nodes to see the actual code they represent
- **More programming languages** - Support for JavaScript, Java, C++, and more
- **Custom themes** - Create and share your own color schemes
- **Export to more formats** - Including Mermaid, PlantUML, and more

If any of these sound interesting or you have other ideas, come join the development!
