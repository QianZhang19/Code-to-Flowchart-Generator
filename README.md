# Code-to-Flowchart-Generator
A Code-to-Flowchart Generator is a tool that automatically creates a visual representation of the logic and structure of a program or code written in a programming language. It converts code into a flowchart, making it easier to understand, visualise, and analyse the code's functionality.
